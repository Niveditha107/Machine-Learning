We are grateful for their support, faith and \\ntrust in our policies. We are determined to ensure that all Indians, regardless \\nof religion, caste, gender and age, make substantial progress in realising their life goals and aspirations.  \\nGlobal Context  \\n2. The global economy, while performing better than expected, is still in \\nthe grip of policy uncertainties. Elevated asset prices, political uncertainties and shipping disruptions continue to pose significant downside risks for \\ngrowth and upside risks to inflation.  \\n3. In this context, India’s economic growth  continues  to be the shining \\nexception and will remain so in the years ahead. India’s inflation continues to be low, stable and moving towards the 4 per cent target. Core inflation (non-\\nfood, non -fuel) currently is 3.1 per cent. Steps are being taken to ensure \\nsuppl ies of perishable goods reach market adequately.   2  \\n \\nInterim Budget  \\n4. As mentioned in the interim budget, we need to focus on 4 major \\ncastes, namely  ‘Garib’ (Poor), ‘Mahilayen’ (Women), ‘Yuva’ (Youth) and  \\n‘Annadata’ (Farmer). For Annadata, we announced higher Minimum Support \\nPrices a month ago for all major crops, delivering on the promise of at least a \\n50 per cent margin over costs.  Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Anna Yojana was \\nextended for five years, benefitting more than 80 crore people.  \\n5. Administrative actio ns for approval and implementation of various \\nschemes announced in the interim budget are well underway. The required \\nallocations have been made.   \\nBudget Theme  \\n6. Turning attention to the full year and beyond, in this budget, we \\nparticularly focus on employment, skilling, MSMEs, and the middle class. I am happy to announce the Prime Minister’s package of 5 schemes and initiatives \\nto facilitate employment, skilling and other opportunities for 4.1 crore youth \\nover a 5 -year period with a central outlay of ` 2 lakh crore.  I will speak about \\nthem shortly, while more details may be seen in the annexure.  This year, I have made a provision of ` 1.48 lakh crore for education, employment and \\nskilling.     \\nBudget Priorities  \\n7. The people have given a unique opportunity to  our government to \\ntake the country on the path of strong development and all -round prosperity. \\nIn the interim budget, we promised to present a detailed roadmap for our \\npursuit of ‘ Viksit Bharat’. In line with the strategy set out in the interim \\nbudget, this budget envisages sustained efforts on the following 9 priorities \\nfor generating ample opportunities for all.   \\n1) Productivity and resilience in Agriculture  \\n2) Employment & Skilling  \\n3) Inclusive Human Resource Development and Social Justice  \\n4) Manufacturing & Services  \\n5) Urban Development    \\n6) Energy Security  \\n7) Infrastructure   3  \\n \\n8) Innovation, Research & Development and  \\n9) Next Generation Reforms  \\n8. Subsequent budgets will build on these, and add more priorities and \\nactions. A more detailed formulation will be carried out as part  of the \\n‘economic policy framework’ about which I will speak later in this speech.   \\n9. This budget details some of the specific actions to be initiated in the \\ncurrent year towards fulfilment of these priorities with potential for \\ntransformative changes.  The  budget also covers some of the previously \\nmade announcements with an intent to strengthen them and step up their implementation for expediting our journey towards the goal of Viksit Bharat.   \\nPriority 1: Productivity and resilience in Agriculture  \\nTransfor ming agriculture research  \\n10. Our government will undertake a comprehensive review of the \\nagriculture research setup to bring the focus on raising productivity and \\ndeveloping climate resilient varieties.  Funding will be provided in challenge \\nmode, including to the private sector. Domain experts both from the \\ngovernment and outside will oversee the conduct of such research.   \\nRelease of new varieties  \\n11. New 109 high -yielding and climate -resilient varieties of 32 field and \\nhorticulture crops will be released for cu ltivation by farmers.  \\nNatural Farming  \\n12. In the next two years, 1 crore farmers across the country will be \\ninitiated into natural farming supported by certification and branding. \\nImplementation will be through scientific institutions and willing gram \\npanchay ats. 10,000 need -based bio -input resource centres will be \\nestablished.   \\nMissions for pulses and oilseeds  \\n13. For achieving self -sufficiency in pulses and oilseeds, we will \\nstrengthen their production, storage and marketing. As announced in the \\ninterim budget, a  strategy  is being put in place to achieve ‘atmanirbharta’ for \\noil seeds such as mustard, groundnut, ses ame, soybean, and sunflower.    4  \\n \\nVegetable production & Supply Chains  \\n14. Large scale clusters for vegetable production will be developed closer \\nto major consumption centres. We will promote Farmer- Producer \\nOrganizations, cooperatives and start -ups for vegetable  supply chains \\nincluding for collection, storage, and marketing.  \\nDigital Public Infrastructure for Agriculture  \\n15. Buoyed by the success of the pilot project, our government, in \\npartnership with the states, will facilitate the implementation of the Digital \\nPublic Infrastructure  (DPI) in agriculture for coverage of farmers and their \\nlands in 3 years. During this year, digital crop survey for Kharif using the DPI will be taken up in 400 districts. The details of 6 crore farmers and their lands \\nwill be brought into the farmer and land registries. Further, the issuance of \\nJan Samarth based Kisan Credit Cards will be enabled in 5 states.  \\nShrimp Production & Export  \\n16.

This year, I have made a provision of ` 1.52 lakh crore for agriculture \\nand allied sector.     \\nPriority 2: Employment & Skilling  \\nEmployment Linked Incentive  \\n19. Our government will implement following 3 schemes for ‘Employment \\nLinked Incentive’, as part of the Prime Minister’s package. These will be based on enrolment in the EPFO, and focus on recognition of first- time \\nemployees, and  support to employees and employers.     \\n  5  \\n \\nScheme A: First Timers  \\n20. This scheme will provide one -month wage to all persons newly \\nentering the workforce in all formal sectors. The direct benefit transfer of \\none-month salary in 3 instalments to first -time employees, as registered in \\nthe EPFO, will be up to ` 15,000. The eligibility limit will be a salary of  \\n` 1 lakh per month. The scheme is expected to benefit 210 lakh youth.  \\nScheme B: Job Creation in manufacturing  \\n21. This scheme will incentivize additional employment in the \\nmanufacturing sector, linked to the employment of first- time employees. An \\nincentive will be provided at specified scale directly both to the employee \\nand the employer with respect to their EPFO contribution in the first 4 years \\nof employment. The scheme is expected to benefit 30 lakh youth entering \\nemployment, and their employers.  \\nScheme C: Support to employers  \\n22. This employer- focussed scheme will cover additional employment in \\nall sectors. All addi tional employment within a salary of ` 1 lakh per month \\nwill be counted.

The scheme is expected to incentivize addi tional employment of \\n50 lakh persons.    \\nParticipation of women in the workforce  23. We will facilitate higher participation of women in the workforce \\nthrough setting up of working women hostels in collaboration with industry, \\nand establishing creches. In addition, the partnership will seek to organize \\nwomen- specific skilling programmes, and promotion of market access for \\nwomen SHG enterprises.  \\nSkilling programme  \\n24. I am happy to announce a new centrally sponsored scheme, as the 4\\nth \\nscheme under the Prime Minister’s package, for skilling in collaboration with \\nstate governments and Industry. 20 lakh youth will be skilled over a 5 -year \\nperiod. 1,000 Industrial Training Institutes will be upgraded in hub and spoke \\narrangements with outcome orientation.

This measure \\nis expected to help 25,000 students every year.  \\nEducation Loans  \\n26.
